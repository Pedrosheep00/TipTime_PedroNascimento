This is a android application developed with the help of the Kotlin Android website, for customers to tip people for services and goods.
Mainly for restaurant users, and customers, with a couple pages, simple to use.
You could change the percentage of the tip according to the value of the service and how good it was.
There's also a slider button in case you would like to round up the value of the tip, to a round number.

The development of the app in itself was easy and intuitive, for the fact that the website could help a lot and explain evry part of it.
To connect the back end (the calculation of the tip), and the input of the value of the service from the customer was a bit of a issue
still not something complicated enough that couldnt be done with the help of the website.
